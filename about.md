# Shaping the Future of Digital Journalism

Welcome to **HTML5 Magazine**, a Nairobi-based digital publication dedicated to exploring the intersection of modern web standards, clean design, and impactful storytelling.

### Our Mission
Our goal is to provide a "print-like" reading experience on the web. We believe that news should not just be informative, but also beautiful, accessible, and fast. By using open-source tools and semantic HTML5, we are proving that high-quality publishing doesn't require expensive proprietary software.

### Who We Are
Founded by **Amos Wasike**, this project started as an experiment in minimalist web design. Today, it serves as a hub for tech enthusiasts, designers, and anyone interested in the future of the open web.

### Why HTML5?
* **Accessibility:** Content that everyone can read, regardless of device.
* **Performance:** Lightweight pages that load instantly, even on slow connections.
* **Sustainability:** Built on open standards that will last for decades.
